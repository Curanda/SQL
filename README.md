# Tour Operator Database
### by M.Kuranda & M.Kozlowska

This is our semestral assignment in SQL on WSB-NLU and has gotten us **max 15/15 points**. It's meticulously commented to reflect the function of every query, procedure, trigger and a table.
Instead of letting the back-end do the lifting programmaticaly, we decided to implement all the logic behind this database in **SQL** itself.
This database is in fact a recreation of something, I've worked with briefly as an end-user during my career in tourism, 
which means I've only seen query results but not the original database. 
Knowing the subject matter and typically useful queries helped us devise the logic.

== Special mention to prof. H. Telega, who has opened up for us the door to the magic world of SQL. What a legend. ==
